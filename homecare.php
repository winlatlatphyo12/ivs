                                        Our aging population is creating a greater demand for home healthcare. Many elderly patients (some might need hospital care) prefer to remain in their homes, where they are comfortable. In some cases, homecare may be a more affordable option than an institutional care. With increasing demand for financial coverage, “working mom” needs a professional caregiver for their little ones. Home caregivers may also be called as personal caregivers, personal attendants and home attendants. They perform personal care and some housekeeping tasks, helping the patient relax at home. They are generally employed by Home Care Agencies or directly by families to provide care for an elderly or disabled family member. Their tasks are centered around two main principles:

                                        They generally perform daily tasks for patients who can’t live alone without help. This helps patients to stay at home instead of moving to a nursing home. Their duties are generally referred as Activities of Daily Living such as bathing, grooming, eating, toileting etc. They also include light housekeeping tasks to keep the environment clean and tidy.
